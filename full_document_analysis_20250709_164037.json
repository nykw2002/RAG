Here's the analysis based on the provided chunks:\n\n1. **Mentions of Israel**:\n   - **Page 2**: The material description \"AVAMYS NASAL SPRAY 0.05% 120SPRX1 IL-GSK\" with item code \"10000000097173\" indicates a product related to Israel (IL is the country code for Israel).\n\n2. **Appendices and Tables**:\n   - **Page 4**: The table of contents lists \"Appendix 3 - Unsubstantiated Complaints\". This appendix is likely where detailed complaint data, including those related to Israel, would be found.\n\n3. **Complaints Section**:\n   - **Page 6**: Section 6.2 is titled \"Complaints\". This section should be checked for any specific mentions of Israel-related complaints.\n\n4. **Appendix 3**:\n   - Since Appendix 3 is specifically for unsubstantiated complaints, it is crucial to review this section for any entries related to Israel. However, the content of Appendix 3 is not provided in the current chunks.\n\n5. **Running Total**:\n   - Based on the current chunks, we have identified a potential link to Israel through the product code on Page 2. However, without the content of Appendix 3 or specific complaint entries, we cannot confirm additional complaints beyond the initial 3 found.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTo reach the total of 14 unsubstantiated complaints for Israel, further analysis of the document is required, particularly focusing on Appendix 3 and any detailed complaint sections. The current analysis has not yet identified the missing 11 complaints, but it has pointed to where they might be documented.",
